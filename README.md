# Train-Scheduler

On this site, the user can create trains (or buses, etc.) that run on schedules by inputting information into the fields below the table. Upon clicking submit, their new train appears in the table, showing the user their train as well as the calculated next train arrival and minutes until the next train arrival. This data is being stored using Firebase and thus will remain upon reload and across devices.
